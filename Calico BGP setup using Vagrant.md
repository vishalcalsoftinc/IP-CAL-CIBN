Of course. Your intuition is spot on. The original guide used an Ubuntu Desktop or a full Server install which is often heavier than necessary. You can absolutely create a lightweight, CLI-only VM experience that is much closer to WSL in terms of resource usage and ease of access.

The key is to combine two things:
1.  **A Minimal Server OS:** Use an Ubuntu Server "minimal" or "netboot" installation, which does not include a graphical desktop environment by default.
2.  **Automated Provisioning and SSH Access:** Use a tool called **Vagrant** to automate the entire process. Vagrant is a command-line tool that builds and manages virtual machine environments in a simple, reproducible way. It's the perfect solution to your problem.

This approach directly solves your issues:

*   **Instability/Hanging -> Stability:** By not running a GUI, the VM uses far fewer resources, making it significantly more stable and less likely to hang.
*   **Limited Scalability -> Reproducibility:** Vagrant uses a configuration file (`Vagrantfile`). You can destroy and recreate your entire two-VM lab with a single command (`vagrant up`), making it highly scalable and easy to reset.
*   **Unnecessary Weight -> Lightweight CLI:** You'll use a minimal server image. The VMs will boot directly to a command line, consuming minimal RAM and disk space.
*   **Difficult Login -> Seamless SSH:** Vagrant automatically handles SSH keys and port forwarding. You can log in to your VM from your host's terminal with a simple command: `vagrant ssh k8s-master-1`.

### **Revised Guide: Lightweight, CLI-Only VMs with Vagrant**

This revised architecture replaces the manual VirtualBox GUI steps with a fully automated, command-line-driven workflow.

#### **Part 0: The Foundation - Host Environment Setup**

1.  **Install VirtualBox:** You still need VirtualBox as the underlying hypervisor. Install it from the official website.
2.  **Install Vagrant:** This is the new management tool. Download and install Vagrant for your operating system from the [official Vagrant website](https'//www.vagrantup.com/downloads').

#### **Part 1: Define the Virtual Environment with Vagrant**

Instead of clicking through the VirtualBox GUI, you define your entire two-VM setup in a single text file named `Vagrantfile`.

1.  Create a new directory for your project (e.g., `k8s-vagrant-lab`) and navigate into it.
2.  Create a file named `Vagrantfile` inside this directory and paste the following configuration:

```ruby
# Vagrantfile
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

  # Use a standard, minimal Ubuntu 20.04 server image.
  # Vagrant will automatically download this for you.
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/focal64"

  # Disable default folder sharing to improve performance
  config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant", disabled: true

  # Define our first VM: k8s-master-1
  config.vm.define "k8s-master-1" do |master1|
    master1.vm.hostname = "k8s-master-1"
    # Create the private network for BGP peering.
    # Vagrant automatically handles the VirtualBox Host-Only adapter.
    master1.vm.network "private_network", ip: "172.17.42.27"

    # Allocate resources
    master1.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
      vb.memory = "4096" # 4GB RAM
      vb.cpus = "2"
    end
  end

  # Define our second VM: k8s-master-2
  config.vm.define "k8s-master-2" do |master2|
    master2.vm.hostname = "k8s-master-2"
    master2.vm.network "private_network", ip: "172.17.42.15"

    master2.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
      vb.memory = "4096"
      vb.cpus = "2"
    end
  end
end
```

**What this `Vagrantfile` does:**

*   `config.vm.box = "ubuntu/focal64"`: Specifies the base image. `ubuntu/focal64` is a minimal, CLI-only Ubuntu 20.04 image maintained by Canonical for Vagrant.
*   `config.vm.define "k8s-master-1"`: Begins the configuration block for the first VM.
*   `master1.vm.hostname`: Sets the hostname inside the VM.
*   `master1.vm.network "private_network", ip: "172.17.42.27"`: This is the magic. It tells Vagrant to create a VirtualBox Host-Only network and assign the static IP `172.17.42.27` to this VM's second network interface. This replaces all the manual Netplan configuration.
*   `master1.vm.provider "virtualbox"`: Allows you to set provider-specific configurations, like RAM and CPU.

#### **Part 2: Create and Access the VMs**

Now, from your terminal inside the `k8s-vagrant-lab` directory, run a single command:

```bash
vagrant up
```

Vagrant will now perform all the steps you did manually before:
*   Download the Ubuntu box image (if not already cached).
*   Create two new virtual machines in VirtualBox.
*   Configure the NAT and Host-Only network adapters for each.
*   Boot the VMs (they will have no GUI).
*   Assign the correct hostnames and static IPs.

Once the command finishes, your two lightweight, CLI-only VMs are running.

**To access them, simply use:**

```bash
# To get a shell on the first VM
vagrant ssh k8s-master-1

# To get a shell on the second VM
vagrant ssh k8s-master-2
```

You will be dropped directly into a `bash` prompt inside the VM. No password is required because Vagrant automatically manages SSH keys. To exit, just type `exit` or press `Ctrl+D`.

#### **Part 3: Continue with the Kubernetes Installation**

Once you are inside a VM (e.g., after running `vagrant ssh k8s-master-1`), you are an administrator and can proceed with the original guide, **skipping all the VirtualBox and Netplan configuration sections.**

You would start directly from **Section 0.3: Common Configuration on BOTH VMs**, specifically the "Prepare for Kubernetes Installation" step (disabling swap, setting up kernel modules, etc.).

The rest of the guide (installing `containerd`, `kubeadm`, `Calico`, and configuring BGP) remains exactly the same. The only difference is that your underlying VMs are now minimal, stable, and incredibly easy to manage.

### **Vagrant Lifecycle Commands**

Vagrant gives you a simple set of commands to manage your lab:

*   `vagrant up`: Creates and starts the VMs.
*   `vagrant halt`: Shuts down the VMs gracefully.
*   `vagrant ssh <vm-name>`: Connects to a running VM.
*   `vagrant status`: Shows the status of your VMs.
*   `vagrant destroy -f`: **Deletes the VMs and all their data.** This is perfect for starting over with a clean slate.

This Vagrant-based approach gives you the best of both worlds: the isolation of VirtualBox with the lightweight, CLI-first, and automated feel of a modern tool like WSL or Docker.
