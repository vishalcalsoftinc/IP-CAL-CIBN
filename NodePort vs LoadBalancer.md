## üü© **When you use a NodePort service:**

- Kubernetes allocates a **port (e.g., 30080)** on _every_ worker node.
    
- Requests to `<NodeIP>:30080` get forwarded (by kube-proxy) to one of the backend pods selected by the service.
    
- By default, kube-proxy uses a **round-robin** algorithm (or IP-hash, depending on mode) to distribute traffic across the pods.
    

‚úÖ **So yes: NodePort does do basic load balancing** across multiple pods behind the service.

## ‚öñÔ∏è **How this is different from a LoadBalancer service:**

||NodePort|LoadBalancer|
|---|---|---|
|How it exposes|Opens a fixed port on _every_ node|Creates an external cloud load balancer (e.g., AWS ELB, GCP LB)|
|Client access|Clients must know `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>` of _any_ worker node|Clients get a single external IP (managed by the cloud provider)|
|Load balancing|kube-proxy distributes requests across pods|Cloud load balancer forwards to all worker nodes ‚Üí kube-proxy distributes to pods|
|External IP|No external IP by default (must use node IPs)|Cloud assigns an external IP automatically|
|Level|Basic TCP/UDP round-robin on nodes|More advanced load balancing, health checks, sometimes SSL termination|

## üß© **Architecture difference:**

- **NodePort:**
    
    - Exposes the service on all node IPs at a static port.
        
    - kube-proxy handles the actual pod selection and forwarding.
        
- **LoadBalancer:**
    
    - Creates an _external_ cloud load balancer.
        
    - That external LB then forwards traffic to the NodePort on all worker nodes.
        
    - Then kube-proxy on each node load balances to the pods.
        

So, even LoadBalancer service still _internally_ uses NodePort, but adds a real cloud-managed LB in front.

---

## ‚úÖ **In summary:**

- Both NodePort and LoadBalancer **do load balancing** across pods.
    
- NodePort is simpler, internal to the cluster, and depends on node IPs.
    
- LoadBalancer uses an external, managed load balancer with a public IP, better suited for production, internet-facing services.
    

If you'd like, I can draw a small diagram or sequence flow to illustrate this too!
