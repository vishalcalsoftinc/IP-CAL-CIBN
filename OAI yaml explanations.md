A "working" configuration is one thing, but *understanding* it is the key to debugging, customizing, and building upon it. Let's break down your OAI Kubernetes files with a focus on simple language, clear analogies, and explaining every single configuration detail.

### **The Big Idea: From Manual Connections to an Automated Phonebook**

Think of your old VM-based setup like a group of people who only know each other by their exact home address (their static IP). If anyone moves (a VM is rebooted and gets a new IP), all the address books are wrong, and communication breaks.

Kubernetes works like a company with a smart internal phonebook (called **DNS**) and a receptionist for each department (called a **Service**).

*   You don't need to know a pod's direct IP address. You just need to know its "department name" (the Service name, like `du-svc`).
*   When a pod needs to talk to the "DU department," it just asks the Kubernetes phonebook for `du-svc`.
*   The `du-svc` receptionist then directs the call to a DU pod that is currently working. If a DU pod crashes and is replaced, the receptionist automatically updates its list.

This is the central concept we'll see over and over.

### **Component 1: OAI CU-CP (The gNB's Control Brain)**

**Job:** The CU-CP is the manager. It handles all the control-plane signaling. It talks to the DU to manage radio resources, talks to the CU-UP to set up data paths, and talks to the main 5G Core (AMF) to register users.

#### **`ConfigMap` (`oai-cucp-config`): The Settings File**

This is the rulebook for the CU-CP. Let's go through it line by line.

| Parameter                | K8s Value in Config          | Simple Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :----------------------- | :--------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`Active_gNBs`**        | `"gNB-OAI"`                  | The friendly name for our gNB. Just for logging and identification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **`gNB_ID`**             | `0xe00`                      | The unique, official ID for the entire gNB (all its parts). Think of it like a Social Security Number for the gNB. Must be the same in the CU-UP and DU.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **`tracking_area_code`** | `1`                          | Like a postal code for the radio coverage area. When a UE moves from one tracking area to another, it has to notify the core network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **`plmn_list`**          | `mcc=999, mnc=70 ...`        | **The gNB's Passport.** It declares its identity: `mcc` (Mobile Country Code) and `mnc` (Mobile Network Code). This must match what the 5G Core expects.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **`snssaiList`**         | `sst=1, sd=0x111111`         | **The Menu of Services.** This lists the "network slices" the gNB offers. A slice is a virtual network customized for a specific need (e.g., fast internet, IoT). `sst` is the service type (e.g., 1 = enhanced Mobile Broadband) and `sd` is a specific identifier for that slice. The UE will request one of these.                                        |
| **`tr_s_preference`**    | `"f1"`                       | "Transport Preference." This simply says, "I prefer to use the F1 interface protocol for my operations."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **`amf_ip_address`**     | `{ ipv4 = "172.17.42.27"; }` | **CRUCIAL: The Core Network's Address.** This tells the CU-CP where to find the 5G Core's AMF. In K8s, we don't point to a pod's IP. We point to the **Node's IP** (`172.17.42.27`) because the AMF service is exposed via a `NodePort`. The CU-CP sends its N2 messages to the physical machine, and the NodePort service forwards it to the right AMF pod. |
| **`local_s_address`**    | `0.0.0.0`                    | **My Own Address.** This is a placeholder. In the Deployment, we use a K8s trick `$(POD_IP)` to dynamically tell the pod, "Use whatever IP you were assigned as your own address." This makes it incredibly flexible.                                                                                                                                        |
| **`remote_s_address`**   | `0.0.0.0`                    | **The DU's Address.** This is also a placeholder. In the Deployment, we override this to `du-svc`. The CU-CP will ask the K8s phonebook for the address of `du-svc` to establish the F1-C connection.                                                                                                                                                        |
| **`security`**           | `{...}`                      | Defines the encryption (`ciphering_algorithms`) and integrity protection (`integrity_algorithms`) rules. `nea0` means "no encryption," and `nia2` is a standard integrity algorithm. `drb_ciphering = "yes"` enables encryption for the actual user data.                                                                                                    |
| **`E1_INTERFACE`**       | `{...}`                      | This section defines the E1 connection to the CU-UP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `type`                   | `"cp"`                       | "I am the control-plane side of the E1 connection."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `ipv4_cucp`              | `0.0.0.0`                    | Placeholder for its own E1 address, which will be filled in by `$(POD_IP)`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `ipv4_cuup`              | `0.0.0.0`                    | Placeholder for the CU-UP's E1 address. The Deployment will override this with the service name `cuup-svc`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

#### **`Service` (`cucp-svc`): The CU-CP's Receptionist**

This creates a stable address (`cucp-svc`) for other pods to find the CU-CP.

| Port Name | Protocol | What it's for | Why this protocol? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`f1-c`** | `SCTP` | The hotline for the DU to talk to the CU-CP. | **SCTP is for VIP calls.** 3GPP chose SCTP for control signals because it's like a registered letter: it's reliable, ensures messages arrive in the right order, and can handle multiple "streams" at once. |
| **`e1`** | `SCTP` | The hotline for the CU-UP to talk to the CU-CP. | Same reason. This is an important control connection, so we use the reliable SCTP protocol. |
| **`n2`** | `SCTP` | The main line to the 5G Core's AMF. | This is the most critical signaling path. All UE registration and session management goes through here, so it absolutely needs the reliability of SCTP. |

#### **`Deployment` (`oai-cucp`): The CU-CP's Boss**

This ensures the CU-CP pod is running and configures it on the fly. The most important part is the `command` and `args` section. It starts the `nr-softmodem` application and **injects the dynamic addresses**, overriding the placeholders in the config file.

`args: /opt/oai/nr-softmodem ... --gNBs.[0].remote_s_address du-svc`

This command says: "Start the CU-CP, and when you need to talk to the DU, don't look at the config file, use the address `du-svc` instead."

---

### **Component 2: OAI CU-UP (The gNB's Data Muscle)**

**Job:** The CU-UP is the heavy lifter. It doesn't care about signaling; its only job is to forward the user's actual data (video, web traffic) between the DU and the 5G Core's UPF as fast as possible.

#### **`ConfigMap` (`oai-cuup-config`): The Settings File**

| Parameter | K8s Value in Config | Simple Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`gNB_CU_UP_ID`** | `0xe01` | A unique ID for this specific CU-UP instance. |
| **`remote_s_address`** | `0.0.0.0` | Placeholder for the DU's address, which will be overridden by the Deployment `args` to `du-svc`. |
| **`E1_INTERFACE.ipv4_cucp`** | `cucp-svc` | **Service Discovery!** Here we see the K8s way. It's configured to find its control-plane partner by simply using its service name `cucp-svc`. No IP needed! |
| **`GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU_UPF`** | `"172.17.42.27"` | **Address of the Core Data Handler.** This is the IP of the K8s node running the Open5GS UPF. |
| **`GNB_PORT_FOR_NGU_UPF`** | `30152` | **The Core Data Handler's Port.** This is the specific `NodePort` on that machine where the Open5GS UPF is listening for user data. |

#### **`Service` (`cuup-svc`): The CU-UP's Receptionist**

| Port Name | Protocol | What it's for | Why this protocol? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`e1-interface`**| `SCTP` | The control connection to the CU-CP. | For reliable control signaling, just like before. |
| **`gtp-u-n3`** | `UDP` | The data pipe to the 5G Core UPF (N3 interface). | **UDP is for bulk shipping.** User data is encapsulated in GTP-U, which runs over UDP. UDP is "fire-and-forget"—it's much faster than SCTP/TCP because it doesn't wait for acknowledgements, making it perfect for high-speed data forwarding. |
| **`f1-u`** | `UDP` | The data pipe from the DU (F1-U interface). | Same reason. This is the user data coming up from the radio layers, so we use fast UDP/GTP-U. |

#### **`Deployment` (`oai-cuup`): The CU-UP's Boss**

Similar to the CU-CP, its `command` and `args` start the `nr-cuup` application and inject the correct service names (`du-svc`, `cucp-svc`) and the pod's own IP (`$(POD_IP)`) at runtime.

---

### **Component 3: OAI DU (The Radio Antenna Manager)**

**Job:** The DU handles the "dirty work" of the radio link. It manages the lowest layers of the protocol stack and, in our simulation, acts as the server that the UE connects to.

#### **`ConfigMap` (`oai-du-config`): The Radio Rulebook**

This is the most detailed config.

| Parameter | K8s Value in Config | Simple Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`gNB_DU_ID`** | `0xe01` | A unique ID for the DU component. |
| **`servingCellConfigCommon`** | `{...}` | This huge block is the **heart of the radio configuration.** |
| `physCellId` | `0` | The cell's local ID. Like an apartment number. UEs use this to distinguish between nearby cells. |
| `absoluteFrequencySSB` | `641280` | The exact radio channel (frequency) where the UE can find the gNB's initial synchronization signal (SSB). |
| `dl_frequencyBand` | `78` | The 3GPP-defined frequency band number. |
| `prach_...` parameters | `{...}` | **The Doorbell Settings.** These configure the PRACH (Physical Random Access Channel), which is how a UE first says "Hello, I'm here!" to the network. It defines the timing, power, and sequences for this initial contact. |
| `pucch...` parameters | `{...}` | **The Uplink Feedback Channel Settings.** Configures the PUCCH, which the UE uses to send small control information back to the gNB, like acknowledgements (HARQ) and channel quality reports (CSI). |
| **`MACRLCs`** | `{...}` | This section configures the F1 interface connections. |
| `remote_n_address` | `cucp-svc` | Here, the config file itself is set to use the service name for the F1-C connection to the CU-CP. |
| `remote_n_address_f1u` | `cuup-svc` | This should be configured (in your provided YAML, it's done via deployment args) to point to the CU-UP service for the F1-U data connection. |
| **`rfsimulator`** | `serveraddr = "server"` | This command tells the DU, "You are the server in this simulation. Listen for a UE to connect to you." |

#### **`Service` (`du-svc`): The gNB's Front Door**

This is the most important service, as it's the entry point for almost everything.

| Port Name | Protocol | Who Connects Here? | Why this protocol? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`f1-c`** | `SCTP` | The OAI CU-CP pod. | For reliable F1 control signals. |
| **`f1-u`** | `UDP` | The OAI CU-UP pod. | For fast F1 user data forwarding. |
| **`rfsim`** | `TCP` | **The OAI NR-UE pod.** | For the simulated radio link. TCP is used here because the simulation needs a reliable, ordered stream to exchange radio data (IQ samples) and control commands between the DU and UE. |

---

### **Component 4: OAI NR-UE (The Simulated 5G Phone)**

**Job:** To act like a real phone. It will find the DU's signal, connect, authenticate, and try to pass data.

#### **`ConfigMap` (`nrue-config`): The Phone's SIM Card**

| Parameter | K8s Value in Config | Simple Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`imsi`** | `999700000000010` | The International Mobile Subscriber Identity. **This is the UE's primary identifier.** It MUST be registered in the Open5GS WebUI. |
| **`key` / `opc`** | `...` | The secret keys stored on the SIM card. They must match the keys stored in Open5GS for the IMSI above, or authentication will fail. |
| **`dnn`** | `"internet"` | **"What I want to connect to."** The UE tells the network it wants to access the "internet" Data Network. The 5G Core must be configured to provide this. |
| **`nssai_sst/sd`** | `1 / 0x111111` | **"Which service I want."** The UE requests to be placed on the network slice for enhanced Mobile Broadband (sst=1). |

#### **`Deployment` (`oai-nr-ue`): The Phone's "On" Button**

This deployment starts the `nr-uesoftmodem` process.

*   `image: vishalcalsoftinc/oai-nr-ue:develop`: Uses your dedicated, smaller UE image.
*   The `command` and `args` are the final, critical piece:
    *   `--rfsim`: Tells the UE to run in simulation mode (as a client).
    *   `-r 106 -C 3619200000`: Radio settings that **must match the DU's config** for the UE to "tune in" to the correct channel.
    *   `--rfsimulator.serveraddr du-svc`: **This is the final connection.** The UE is told to find its radio tower by looking up the `du-svc` name in the K8s phonebook. It will then connect to the RF simulator port on the DU pod, kicking off the entire 5G attachment procedure.

By creating these files and applying them to your cluster, you are telling Kubernetes to assemble this entire complex puzzle automatically, using services as the glue instead of fragile, hard-coded IP addresses.
