This section breaks down your project's architecture diagram. The goal is to understand the purpose of each box and line, and how they work together to connect a simulated phone (UE) to the internet.

Your architecture consists of two main parts deployed on separate Kubernetes clusters:
1.  **The Radio Access Network (NG-RAN):** Implemented using OpenAirInterface (OAI). This part manages the radio connection.
2.  **The 5G Core (5GC):** Implemented using Open5GS. This is the brain and control center of the mobile network.

Let's break them down.

#### **A. The Radio Access Network (NG-RAN) - Your OAI Setup (`oai-k8s-vm`)**

The NG-RAN's job is to be the 5G base station, called a **gNB** (next-generation NodeB). ==In modern 5G networks, the gNB is no longer a single, monolithic box. It's disaggregated (split apart) for flexibility and efficiency==, which is exactly what your diagram shows. This is a key concept of **O-RAN (Open RAN)**.

**1. The O-RAN CU/DU Split:**

==Your gNB is split into a **Distributed Unit (DU)** and a **Centralized Unit (CU)**.==

*   **DU (Distributed Unit):** Think of the DU as the "muscle" of the base station. It's responsible for the time-sensitive, lower-level radio functions (PHY, MAC, RLC layers). It handles the real-time processing of the radio signals to and from the UE.
*   **CU (Centralized Unit):** The CU is the "brain." It handles the higher-level, less time-critical protocol functions. One CU can manage multiple DUs, which is why it's "centralized." Your architecture shows a further split within the CU:
    *   **CU-CP (Centralized Unit - Control Plane):** This is the local traffic controller for signaling. It manages the **RRC (Radio Resource Control)** protocol, which is responsible for establishing, maintaining, and tearing down the radio connection with the UE. It's the primary point of contact for the 5G Core's AMF.
    *   **CU-UP (Centralized Unit - User Plane):** This is the local data handler. It processes the user's actual data packets (e.g., your video stream or web page data) before they are sent to the DU (downlink) or after they are received from the DU (uplink). It handles the **SDAP** and **PDCP** protocols.

**2. Key OAI Components and Their Roles:**

*   **OAI UE (+ rf-simulator):** This is your test phone. The `rf-simulator` replaces the real-world radio waves, allowing the entire system to run in software on a server. The UE holds the SIM card information (IMSI, security keys) and initiates the connection to the network.
*   **OAI DU:** Implements the DU functions. Its primary job is to communicate with the CU over the **F1 interface**.
*   **OAI CU-CP:** Implements the CU-CP functions. It talks "down" to the DU (via F1-C) and "up" to the 5G Core's AMF (via N2).
*   **OAI CU-UP:** Implements the CU-UP functions. It talks "down" to the DU (via F1-U) and "up" to the 5G Core's UPF (via N3).

#### **B. The 5G Core (5GC) - Your Open5GS Setup (`open5gs-vm`)**

The 5GC is the heart of the network. Unlike older network architectures, ==the 5G Core uses a **Service-Based Architecture (SBA)**. This means the components are independent "Network Functions" (NFs) that expose their capabilities as services and communicate via APIs, often over HTTP/2==. This makes the system modular, scalable, and cloud-native.

**1. Key Open5GS Components (Network Functions - NFs):**

*   **AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function):** The **Gatekeeper**. This is the entry point for all signaling traffic from the RAN.
    *   **Primary Roles:** ==UE registration, authentication, connection management, and mobility management (handling handovers). It's the component that decides if a UE is allowed to join the network.==
*   **UPF (User Plane Function):** The **Super-Router**. This is the anchor point for all user data.
    *   **Primary Roles:** ==Packet routing and forwarding between the RAN and the Internet. It inspects packets, enforces policies (like speed limits), performs usage reporting (for billing), and acts as the gateway to the N6 interface (Internet).==
*   **Other Essential NFs (Running in the background but crucial to know):**
    *   ==**SMF (Session Management Function):** The **Session Manager**==. The AMF offloads all session-related tasks to the SMF. When a UE wants to access the internet, the SMF is responsible for establishing a "PDU Session." It allocates an IP address to the UE and instructs the UPF on how to route the user's data traffic.
    *   ==**NRF (Network Repository Function):** The **Service Directory**==. In the SBA, how does the AMF find an available SMF? It asks the NRF. All NFs register their profiles with the NRF, which allows them to discover each other dynamically.
    *   ==**AUSF (Authentication Server Function) & UDM (Unified Data Management):** The **Security Guards**==. The AUSF handles the authentication process, and the UDM stores the subscriber's long-term data and security credentials (retrieved from the database you manage with the WebUI).

#### **C. The Communication Links: Interfaces and Protocols**

These are the "lines" on your diagram, defining how the components talk to each other. Understanding the protocol used on each interface is vital for network troubleshooting (e.g., using `tcpdump` or Wireshark).

| Interface | Connects          | Plane         | Protocol  | Purpose                                                                                                         |
| :-------- | :---------------- | :------------ | :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **F1**    | DU ↔ CU           | Both          | -         | The main interface splitting the gNB.                                                                           |
| ↳ `F1-C`  | DU ↔ CU-CP        | Control Plane | **SCTP**  | Carries signaling for managing the radio link between the DU and CU.                                            |
| ↳ `F1-U`  | DU ↔ CU-UP        | User Plane    | **GTP-U** | Tunnels the user's data packets between the DU and CU-UP.                                                       |
| **E1**    | CU-CP ↔ CU-UP     | Control Plane | **HTTP**  | Allows the CU-CP to control the CU-UP, setting up the necessary data bearers for a UE.                          |
| **N2**    | gNB (CU-CP) ↔ AMF | Control Plane | **SCTP**  | The primary control link between the entire RAN and the Core. Carries all UE registration and session requests. |
| **N3**    | gNB (CU-UP) ↔ UPF | User Plane    | **GTP-U** | The primary data link. A **GTP Tunnel** is created here to carry all of the UE's internet traffic.              |
| **N6**    | UPF ↔ Internet    | User Plane    | IP        | The final link from the mobile network to the external Data Network (DN).                                       |

*   **Why SCTP?** Stream Control Transmission Protocol is used for signaling because it's message-oriented and provides reliable, in-order delivery across multiple streams, which is perfect for managing many different UEs and their control messages simultaneously.
*   **Why GTP-U?** [[GPRS Tunneling Protocol]] for User Plane is used to "tunnel" the UE's IP packets through the operator's network. It adds a GTP header that tells the network elements (like the UPF) which user this data belongs to.

#### **D. Putting It All Together: The End-to-End Flows**

This is how the static diagram comes to life.

**Flow 1: UE Registration (The "Hello, can I join?" flow)**

This is purely a **Control Plane** activity.
1.  The **UE** powers on and sends a Registration Request message over the (simulated) airwaves.
2.  The **DU** receives this and forwards it to the **CU-CP** over the `F1-C` interface.
3.  The **CU-CP** understands this is a request for the core network. It packages the request into an N2 message and sends it to the **AMF** over the `N2` interface.
4.  The **AMF** receives the request. It now orchestrates the authentication process, talking to the **AUSF** and **UDM** to verify the UE's credentials (from the SIM card).
5.  If authentication is successful, the AMF accepts the registration and sends a confirmation back down the same path to the UE. The UE is now `REGISTERED` on the network.

**Flow 2: PDU Session & Data Transfer (The "Let me browse the internet" flow)**

1.  **Session Setup (Control Plane):**
    *   The now-registered **UE** sends a "PDU Session Establishment Request" to get an internet connection. This request travels the same control path: **UE → DU → CU-CP → AMF**.
    *   The **AMF** sees the session request and selects an **SMF** to handle it (by asking the NRF if needed).
    *   The **SMF** takes over. It allocates an IP address for the UE. It then communicates with the **UPF** to set up a data path and tells the UPF "when you see packets for this session, route them to the internet."
    *   Simultaneously, the SMF (via the AMF) sends control messages down to the **CU-CP** and **DU** to establish the necessary radio data bearers for the user plane. This "primes the pump" for the data flow.

2.  **Data Transfer (User Plane):**
    *   Now the tunnel is built. When you open a web browser on the UE, the IP packets travel on the user plane path:
    *   **UE → DU → (F1-U GTP Tunnel) → CU-UP → (N3 GTP Tunnel) → UPF → (N6 Interface) → INTERNET**
    *   Return traffic from the internet follows the reverse path back to the UE.

By understanding these components, interfaces, and flows, you now have the context needed to examine the configuration files and debug the system effectively. You can see *why* the CU-CP configuration needs the AMF's IP address, and *why* the UE's security keys must match what's in the Open5GS database.

#### E. Protocol Stack

##### The Protocol Stack Analogy: Web Browsing

Think about how you browse the web:
*   Your browser sends a command like `GET /index.html`. This is an **HTTP** message. (Application Layer)
*   This HTTP message needs to be delivered reliably. So, it's put inside a **TCP** segment. (Transport Layer)
*   The TCP segment is then put inside an **IP** packet to be routed across the internet. (Network Layer)

The stack is: **HTTP -> TCP -> IP**. You use HTTP *on top of* TCP.

##### Applying this to Your 5G Diagram

The same principle applies to the 5G control plane interfaces.

###### **1. The N2 Interface (gNB ↔ AMF)**

This interface is for signaling between the Radio Access Network and the Core's access point (the AMF).

*   **Application Layer:** The protocol here is **NGAP (Next Generation Application Protocol)**. NGAP defines the actual 5G messages, such as `Registration Request`, `PDU Session Establishment Request`, and `Handover Required`. These are the "verbs" of the 5G network.
*   **Transport Layer:** The chosen transport protocol to carry these NGAP messages reliably is **SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)**. SCTP is favored over TCP in telecom because it's message-oriented (not a byte stream), supports multi-streaming (preventing head-of-line blocking), and has better support for multi-homing (redundant network paths).

So, the correct protocol stack for the N2 interface is: **NGAP -> SCTP -> IP**.

Your diagram correctly labels the transport protocol (SCTP) used on this link.

###### **2. So, Where Does GTP-C Fit In? (And its replacement, PFCP)**

My previous simplification was to say "GTP-C sets up the tunnels". While this is conceptually true in a 4G/EPC context, the mechanism in a pure 5G Core is more nuanced and distributed.

Here is the correct flow for setting up a data session (the N3 GTP-U tunnel):

1.  **UE to gNB to AMF (over N2):** The UE sends a `PDU Session Establishment Request`. This message is carried inside an **NGAP** PDU, which is transported over **SCTP** on the N2 interface to the AMF.
2.  **AMF to SMF (over N11):** The AMF receives the NGAP message. It knows this is a session management task, so it contacts an appropriate **SMF** (Session Management Function) over the N11 interface. In a true Service-Based Architecture, this communication happens via **HTTP/2-based APIs**.
3.  **SMF to UPF (over N4):** The SMF is the "brains" of the user session. It now needs to command the "muscle"—the **UPF**—to actually create the data path. It does this over the **N4 interface**. The protocol used on the N4 interface is **PFCP (Packet Forwarding Control Protocol)**. PFCP has effectively replaced GTP-C for the purpose of controlling the UPF. PFCP messages (like `PFCP Session Establishment Request`) tell the UPF:
    *   "Create a session for this user."
    *   "Here is the TEID the gNB will use for uplink traffic."
    *   "Here is the TEID you should use for downlink traffic."
    *   "Apply these charging rules and QoS policies."

**PFCP (running over UDP) is the protocol that directly commands the creation of the GTP-U tunnel.**
