Of course. You've done an excellent job of debugging and providing the exact error logs. You are correct; the startup commands and some underlying configurations need to be adjusted for a single-host WSL environment, as it introduces challenges like port conflicts that don't exist in a multi-VM setup.

Based on your logs, there are three distinct issues:
1.  **OAI CU-UP Fails:** The log `[GTPU] bind: Address already in use` on port 2152 is the key. The OAI CU-UP and the Open5GS UPF are both trying to bind to the same IP and port for the N3 interface, which is not allowed.
2.  **OAI DU Fails:** The log `GSCN 8134... does not belong to GSCN range for band 78` shows that the SSB frequency (`absoluteFrequencySSB`) in your configuration is invalid for NR band n78.
3.  **OAI NR-UE Fails:** The log `Undefined Frequency Range for frequency 0 Hz` indicates the UE doesn't know what frequency to listen on. This is because critical radio parameters must be passed via the command line, not just the config file.

Let's fix all of these issues. Below is a fully revised and corrected guide for **Section 5 and its related configurations**. Please replace the previous configurations and startup steps with these new ones.

### **REVISED GUIDE: Fixing and Starting the Network**

#### **Step 1: Correct the Open5GS UPF Configuration**

To resolve the port conflict, we will tell the Open5GS UPF to listen for N3 traffic on the loopback interface (`127.0.0.7`) instead of the main WSL IP. This frees up the port for the OAI components.

**Edit the file `/etc/open5gs/upf.yaml`** and change only the `gtpu` server address:

```yaml
# /etc/open5gs/upf.yaml

logger:
    file: /var/log/open5gs/upf.log

upf:
    pfcp:
        server:
          - address: 127.0.0.7
    gtpu:
        server:
          # This is the corrected line
          - address: 127.0.0.7 # Changed from the WSL IP to loopback
    session:
      - subnet: 10.45.0.0/16
      - subnet: 2001:db8:cafe::/48
    dev: ogstun
```

#### **Step 2: Correct the OAI DU Configuration**

We will fix the invalid frequency configuration in the DU file.

**Replace the entire content of `/etc/oai/oai-du.conf`** with the corrected version below. This version uses a valid `absoluteFrequencySSB` (`632448`) for NR band 78.

```conf
# /etc/oai/oai-du.conf (Corrected)

gNBs = (
 {
    gNB_ID = 0xe01;
    gNB_DU_ID = 0xe01;
    gNB_name = "oai-du";
    
    plmn_list = ({ mcc = 999; mnc = 70; mnc_length = 2; snssaiList = ({ sst = 1; sd = 0xffffff; },{ sst = 2; sd = 0x111111; });});

    tracking_area_code = 1;
    nr_cellid = 12345688L;

    servingCellConfigCommon = {
      physCellId = 1;
      absoluteFrequencySSB = 632448; # CORRECTED: Valid for n78 (3.48672 GHz)
      dl_frequencyBand = 78;
      dl_absoluteFrequencyPointA = 620000;
      dl_subcarrierSpacing = 1;
      dl_carrierBandwidth = 106;
      ul_frequencyBand = 78;
      ul_subcarrierSpacing = 1;
      ul_carrierBandwidth = 106;
      pMax = 20;
    };
 }
);

MACRLCs = (
  {
    num_cc = 1;
    tr_s_preference = "local_L1";
    tr_n_preference = "f1";
    local_n_address = "172.28.251.212";
    remote_n_address = "172.28.251.212";
    local_n_portc = 500;
    remote_n_portc = 501;
    local_n_portd = 2153;
    remote_n_portd = 2154;
  }
);

rfsimulator: {
  serveraddr = "server";
  serverport = 4043;
};

log_config: {
  global_log_level = "info";
};
```

#### **Step 3: Start All Network Components (Revised Commands)**

Now, with the configurations fixed, we can start the components in the correct order using the correct commands. Open five separate WSL terminals.

**Terminal 1: Start Open5GS Core Network**
Restart the services to ensure they load the new `upf.yaml` configuration.

```bash
# Restart all Open5GS services
sudo systemctl restart open5gs-nrfd open5gs-udmd open5gs-ausfd open5gs-udrd open5gs-pcfd open5gs-smfd open5gs-amfd open5gs-upfd

# Verify that all services are running
sudo systemctl status open5gs-*
```
Ensure all services show `active (running)`.

**Terminal 2: Start OAI CU-CP**
This command remains the same.
```bash
# Navigate to the build directory
cd ~/oai/cmake_targets/ran_build/build

sudo ./nr-softmodem -O /etc/oai/oai-cucp.conf --sa
```

**Terminal 3: Start OAI CU-UP**
This command also remains the same. The previous `bind` error should now be resolved because the Open5GS UPF is no longer using the same interface.
```bash
# Navigate to the build directory
cd ~/oai/cmake_targets/ran_build/build

sudo ./nr-cuup -O /etc/oai/oai-cuup.conf --sa
```

**Terminal 4: Start OAI DU**
This command also remains the same. It will now load the corrected configuration.
```bash
# Navigate to the build directory
cd ~/oai/cmake_targets/ran_build/build

sudo ./nr-softmodem -O /etc/oai/oai-du.conf --rfsim --sa
```

**Terminal 5: Start OAI NR-UE (Corrected Command)**
This is the most critical change. We must provide the radio parameters on the command line, matching the DU's configuration.

```bash
# Navigate to the build directory
cd ~/oai/cmake_targets/ran_build/build

# REVISED COMMAND for nr-ue
sudo ./nr-uesoftmodem -O /etc/oai/nr-ue.conf \
--rfsim \
-r 106 \
--numerology 1 \
--band 78 \
-C 3486720000 \
--sa \
--nokrnmod
```

**Why the new UE command?**
*   `-r 106`: Sets the number of Resource Blocks to 106, matching the DU.
*   `--band 78`: Sets the NR operating band to n78, matching the DU.
*   `-C 3486720000`: This is the crucial part. It sets the carrier frequency in Hz. It corresponds to the `absoluteFrequencySSB = 632448` that we set in the DU. This tells the UE exactly where to "listen".
*   The other flags (`--rfsim`, `--sa`, `--nokrnmod`) are for simulation mode.

With these corrections, the components should now start correctly and establish a full end-to-end connection. You can then proceed to **Section 6: Testing End-to-End Connectivity** by checking for the `oaitun_ue1` interface and pinging the internet.
